# Gstudios

## Introduction
Gstudios is a Kenyan-based graphic design marketplace. The platform serves three main purposes: to showcase Kenyan designers, to exhibit a portfolio of high-quality designs, and to highlight the services offered by these designers. The platform is designed to cater to clients in search of graphic designers and to designers seeking collaborative opportunities. As the sole developer of this project, I was responsible for both front-end and back-end development, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly application.

## The Journey
My journey as a self-taught graphic designer has been marked by challenges and opportunities. One of the significant challenges was marketing my skills and finding other Kenyan designers for collaboration. The existing platforms were not efficient, requiring one to join multiple groups and sift through numerous profiles. Recognizing this gap, I decided to create Gstudios, a platform that efficiently showcases Kenyan designers and their work. The platform simplifies the process of finding a suitable designer, providing quick access to their portfolios on Behance, Dribble, etc. Whether you're looking for a brand identity designer or a marketing designer, Gstudios makes the search process seamless and efficient, all within 5 minutes.
