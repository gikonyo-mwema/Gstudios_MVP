The project involves the development of a Kenyan-centric online platform, tentatively named Gstudios, inspired by Dribbble.
 The platform aims to serve as a marketplace for graphic design services, showcasing the work of both in-house designers of Gstudios and freelance graphic designers across Kenya.
 This platform aims to foster a vibrant community of graphic designers in Kenya, providing them with a platform to showcase their talent and connect with potential clients, while also promoting Gstudios' range of services. The development of this platform will involve careful planning and execution, ensuring a seamless user experience and robust back-end functionality.
